Minimal report
----------------

Goal
---
This project aims at designing a fast, easy-to-use, simple yet robust template of report that can be used to speed up the process of redacting reports for small projects.

Details
---
Only the minimal amount of packages are loaded so that this template is compatible with any LaTeX installation. You can add your own in your "main" file (please do not edit the `.sty` file)

This template is based on the "Article" class for the sake of simplicity. It may therefore not be suited for large reports.
